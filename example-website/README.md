# TechCorp Solutions Demo Website

A professional demo website showcasing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) widget integration for testing and demonstration purposes.

## üéØ Purpose

This demo website demonstrates how to integrate the RAG chat widget into a real-world website, showing different configurations and use cases across multiple pages.

## üìÅ Files

- `index.html` - Homepage with API documentation and general widget
- `about.html` - Company information with corporate-themed widget
- `contact.html` - Contact page with support-themed widget
- `styles.css` - Complete styling for the website and widget integration
- `script.js` - Interactive functionality and widget helpers
- `README.md` - This documentation file

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Start the RAG API Server

First, make sure your RAG API is running:

```bash
# From the project root directory
python simple_api.py
```

The API should be running on `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Upload Some Documents

Use the existing frontend to upload documents to your RAG system:

```bash
# Open the simple frontend
python -m http.server 8080
# Then visit http://localhost:8080/simple_frontend.html
```

Upload some PDF or text documents so the RAG system has content to work with.

### 3. Test the Demo Website

Open the demo website in your browser:

```bash
# From the example-website directory
python -m http.server 3000
# Then visit http://localhost:3000
```

Or simply open `index.html` directly in your browser.

## üõ†Ô∏è Integration with Real API

To connect to your actual RAG API:

1. **Update API Configuration**:
   - Replace `data-api-key="demo-key-123"` with your real API key
   - Ensure `data-api-url` points to your RAG API server

2. **Add CORS Support**:
   Make sure your `simple_api.py` has CORS enabled for the domain hosting this website.

3. **Upload Documents**:
   Use the RAG system's document upload feature to add content that users can query.

## üöß Known Limitations

This is a demo website for testing purposes:

1. **Contact Form**: Currently shows success message but doesn't actually send emails
2. **API Integration**: Uses demo API key - replace with real credentials
3. **Content**: Uses placeholder content - customize for your use case
4. **Analytics**: No analytics tracking implemented
5. **SEO**: Basic SEO - would need optimization for production

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check API Status**: Ensure your RAG API is running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors or network issues
3. **Check CORS**: Ensure the API allows requests from your domain
4. **Test Widget Separately**: Try the widget examples in the `widget/` directory

## üîÑ Next Steps

To make this production-ready:

1. **Replace Demo Content**: Update with your actual company information
2. **Add Real API Keys**: Configure proper authentication
3. **Implement Backend**: Add real contact form processing
4. **Add Analytics**: Implement tracking and monitoring
5. **Optimize Performance**: Add caching and CDN integration
6. **Add SEO**: Implement proper meta tags and structured data
7. **Security**: Add proper input validation and sanitization
