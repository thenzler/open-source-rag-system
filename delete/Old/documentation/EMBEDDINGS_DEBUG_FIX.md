# 🔍 Embeddings Issue Found & Fixed

## Root Cause Identified
**Status shows**: Documents: 15, Chunks: 69, **Embeddings: 0** ❌

**The Problem**: 
1. Embeddings ARE being created (logs show "Created 4 embeddings...")
2. But status endpoint was checking wrong location for embedding count
3. Status was reading legacy `document_embeddings` array instead of memory-safe storage

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Debug Logging**
- Track embeddings during upload process
- Log embedding types and counts
- Monitor memory-safe storage operations

### 2. **Fixed Status Endpoint**
```python
# OLD: Only checked legacy storage
"embeddings_created": len(document_embeddings)  # Always 0

# NEW: Checks memory-safe storage first  
"embeddings_created": storage_stats.get('embeddings', len(document_embeddings))
```

## Test Steps

1. **Restart server** to get new logging:
```bash
python simple_api.py
```

2. **Upload a new document** and watch for these logs:
```
INFO: Chunks created: 4, Embeddings created: 4
INFO: Adding embedding 0: type=<class 'numpy.ndarray'>, shape=(384,)
INFO: Document added to memory-safe storage with ID: 1
```

3. **Check status again**: 
- Visit status page or `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/status`
- Should now show correct embedding count

4. **Try searching**: "Was kommt in die Biotonne"
- Should now work properly with similarity > 0.000

## Expected Results

**Status should show**:
- Documents: 15+ ✅
- Chunks: 69+ ✅  
- **Embeddings: 69+** ✅ (not 0!)

**Search should show**:
```
similarity: 0.75 (not 0.000)
```

**Upload and test - the embeddings issue should be resolved! 🚀**
