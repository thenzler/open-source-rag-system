# ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
**Error**: `cannot access local variable 'memory_safe_storage' where it is not associated with a value`

## Solution Applied
Added proper global variable declaration to the upload function:

```python
async def upload_document(...):
    global document_id_counter, memory_safe_storage  # Fixed scope issue
```

## Test Steps

1. **Restart server**:
```bash
python simple_api.py
```

2. **Try uploading a document** through the web interface at `http://localhost:8001`

3. **Expected result**: Document uploads should work without the scope error

## What Was Wrong
- The `memory_safe_storage` variable was global, but when the exception handler tried to set it to `None`, it created a local variable instead
- This caused a scope error when trying to access it later in the function

## What's Fixed
- Proper global variable declaration ensures the upload function can access and modify the global `memory_safe_storage` variable
- Error handling now works correctly and falls back to legacy storage if needed

**Try uploading a document now - it should work! âœ…**
