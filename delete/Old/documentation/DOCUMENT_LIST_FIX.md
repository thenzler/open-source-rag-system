# ðŸ”§ Document List Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Uploaded documents weren't appearing in the "Uploaded Documents" list

## Root Cause
The `/api/v1/documents` endpoint was only reading from the legacy `documents` array, but when using memory-safe storage, documents are stored in the memory-safe storage system instead.

## Solution Applied
Updated the documents list endpoint to:
1. **Check memory-safe storage first** for documents
2. **Convert storage format** to expected API format  
3. **Fall back to legacy** if memory-safe storage not available

## Code Changes Made

```python
@app.get("/api/v1/documents")
async def list_documents():
    # NEW: Check memory-safe storage first
    if memory_safe_storage:
        stored_docs = memory_safe_storage.get_all_documents(limit=1000)
        # Convert format to match API expectations
        
    # FALLBACK: Legacy documents list
    return legacy_documents
```

## How to Test

1. **Restart your server**:
```bash
python simple_api.py
```

2. **Upload some documents** through the web interface

3. **Check the documents list** - they should now appear!

4. **Verify via API**:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/api/v1/documents
```

## Expected Result

You should now see your uploaded documents in the "Uploaded Documents" section of the web interface, with:
- âœ… Document names
- âœ… File sizes  
- âœ… Upload dates
- âœ… Chunk counts
- âœ… Processing status

**Try uploading and checking the list now! ðŸ“„**
