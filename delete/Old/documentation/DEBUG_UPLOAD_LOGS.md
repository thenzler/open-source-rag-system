# üîç Debug Upload Issue

## Problem Found
Storage debug shows **0 documents** in memory-safe storage even after uploads.

## Debug Logging Added
Added detailed logging to track exactly what happens during upload:

```python
logger.info(f"Attempting to add document to memory-safe storage: {filename}")
logger.info(f"Memory-safe storage stats before: {stats}")
logger.info(f"Document added to memory-safe storage with ID: {doc_id}")
logger.info(f"Memory-safe storage stats after: {stats}")
```

## How to Debug

1. **Restart your server**:
```bash
python simple_api.py
```

2. **Upload a document** through the web interface

3. **Check the console logs** for these specific messages:
   - `Attempting to add document to memory-safe storage:`
   - `Memory-safe storage stats before:`
   - `Document added to memory-safe storage with ID:`
   - `Memory-safe storage stats after:`

4. **If you see any errors**, they'll show exactly what's failing

## Expected Log Pattern

**Success case:**
```
INFO: Attempting to add document to memory-safe storage: test.pdf
INFO: Memory-safe storage stats before: {'documents': 0, 'chunks': 0}
INFO: Document added to memory-safe storage with ID: 1
INFO: Memory-safe storage stats after: {'documents': 1, 'chunks': 3}
```

**Failure case:**
```
INFO: Attempting to add document to memory-safe storage: test.pdf
ERROR: Memory-safe storage failed, falling back to legacy: [error details]
WARNING: Memory-safe storage is None, using legacy storage
```

## What to Look For

- Are we reaching the memory-safe storage code at all?
- Is there an exception being thrown during storage?
- Are the stats actually changing after adding documents?

**Upload a document and share the logs - this will reveal the exact issue! üîç**
