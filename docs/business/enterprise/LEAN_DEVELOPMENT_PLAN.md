## 2. Development Strategy for Small Technical Team

### 2.1 Technology Stack (Optimized for Speed)

#### Backend Stack (Minimal but Powerful)

```python
# Core Framework
FastAPI (async, auto-docs, fast development)
Pydantic (data validation, reduces bugs)
SQLAlchemy (ORM, database migrations)
Alembic (database migrations)

# Database & Storage
PostgreSQL (relational data, JSONB for flexibility)
Redis (caching, sessions, background jobs)
S3-compatible storage (document storage)

# AI/ML Stack
OpenAI API (GPT-4, embeddings) - fastest to implement
Pinecone (managed vector database) - no ops overhead
Sentence Transformers (if local embeddings needed)
LangChain (RAG orchestration, if complex workflows)

# Infrastructure
Docker (containerization)
GitHub Actions (CI/CD)
Railway/Fly.io (simple deployment) OR AWS/GCP if scaling needed
```

#### Frontend Stack (Developer-Friendly)

```javascript
// Framework
React 18 with Vite (fast development, hot reload)
TypeScript (type safety, better refactoring)
Tailwind CSS (rapid UI development)
Zustand or Context API (simple state management)

// Key Libraries
React Query (API state management)
React Hook Form (form handling)
React Router (navigation)
Framer Motion (animations, if needed)
Lucide React (icons)

// Development Tools
ESLint + Prettier (code quality)
Vitest (testing, faster than Jest)
Storybook (component development, if UI-heavy)
```

### 2.2 Development Approach (Maximum Velocity)

#### MVP-First Development

- **Week 1-2**: Basic FastAPI + React setup with auth
- **Week 3-4**: Document upload and basic text extraction
- **Week 5-6**: Vector search with Pinecone integration
- **Week 7-8**: LLM integration and basic Q&A
- **Week 9-10**: Polished UI and user flows
- **Week 11-12**: Deploy and test with first customer

#### Feature Prioritization Framework

1. **Core Value**: Features that directly enable customer success
2. **Customer Requests**: Features requested by paying customers
3. **Competitive Parity**: Features needed to compete effectively
4. **Nice to Have**: Features that improve UX but don't impact core value

#### Development Efficiency Tactics

- **Use Managed Services**: Pinecone, OpenAI, Auth0, Stripe (avoid building infrastructure)
- **Component Libraries**: Tailwind UI, shadcn/ui (avoid building common UI from scratch)
- **Code Generation**: GitHub Copilot, cursor AI (speed up repetitive coding)
- **Template Systems**: FastAPI templates, React templates (quick project setup)
- **Third-party APIs**: Instead of building everything (payments, email, SMS)

## 7. Quality Assurance with Minimal Resources

### 7.1 Automated Quality Assurance

#### Essential Automation

```python
# Code Quality
Black (code formatting)
isort (import sorting)
flake8 (linting)
mypy (type checking)

# Testing Strategy
pytest (unit tests for critical business logic)
pytest-cov (test coverage reporting)
FastAPI test client (API testing)
React Testing Library (component testing)

# Security
bandit (Python security linting)
safety (dependency vulnerability checking)
npm audit (JavaScript dependency checking)

# CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflow:
1. Run tests and linting
2. Build Docker images
3. Deploy to staging
4. Run smoke tests
5. Deploy to production (manual approval)
```

#### Testing Strategy (Realistic for Small Team)

- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic and algorithms (aim for 70%+ coverage on critical paths)
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoints and database operations
- **Manual Testing**: User flows and edge cases (Product Owner can help)
- **Customer Testing**: Beta customers as QA (incentivized with early access/discounts)

### 7.2 Customer-Driven Quality Assurance

#### Beta Customer Program

- **3-5 beta customers** who test features early
- **Weekly feedback sessions** with beta customers
- **Bug bounty** or discounts for finding issues
- **Feature request prioritization** based on customer feedback

#### Customer Success as QA

- **Support tickets** as bug reports and feature requests
- **Customer calls** to understand pain points
- **Usage analytics** to identify problem areas
- **Customer satisfaction surveys** for quality measurement
