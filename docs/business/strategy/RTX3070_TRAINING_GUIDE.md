# RTX 3070 Training Guide

## RTX 3070 Reality Check

### Specs
- **VRAM**: 8GB GDDR6
- **Memory Bandwidth**: 448 GB/s
- **CUDA Cores**: 5888
- **Performance**: Similar to RTX 4060 Ti

### What You CAN Train
```
✅ DialoGPT-small (117M params)     - 3-6 hours
✅ GPT-2 small (124M params)        - 3-6 hours  
✅ DistilGPT-2 (82M params)         - 2-4 hours
⚠️ DialoGPT-medium (345M params)    - 8-12 hours (tight fit)
❌ Mistral-7B                       - Won't fit without heavy optimization
❌ Llama-7B                         - Won't fit
```

### What You CANNOT Train
- Large models (7B+ parameters)
- Multiple models simultaneously
- Large batch sizes (>1)
- Long sequences (>512 tokens)

## RTX 3070 Optimization Strategy

### Essential Optimizations
1. **4-bit Quantization**: Reduces memory by 75%
2. **LoRA (rank 4)**: Trains only 0.5% of parameters
3. **Gradient Checkpointing**: Trades compute for memory
4. **Batch Size 1**: Minimum possible batch
5. **Short Sequences**: Max 256 tokens
6. **Gradient Accumulation**: Simulates larger batches

### Memory Breakdown
```
RTX 3070 (8GB):
- Windows/System: ~1GB
- Model (quantized): ~2GB
- LoRA adapters: ~50MB
- Training overhead: ~3GB
- Gradients: ~1GB
- Available for batch: ~1GB
```

## Training Commands

### Step 1: Generate Training Data
```bash
# Generate Arlesheim training data
python train_arlesheim_model.py
```

### Step 2: Train on RTX 3070
```bash
# Basic training
python train_rtx3070.py

# With custom parameters
python train_rtx3070.py \
  --dataset training_data/arlesheim/arlesheim_training.json \
  --output ./arlesheim-rtx3070-model \
  --epochs 3 \
  --test
```

### Step 3: Test the Model
```bash
# Test after training
python train_rtx3070.py --test
```

## Expected Results

### Training Time
- **DialoGPT-small**: 3-6 hours
- **500 training examples**: ~4 hours
- **3 epochs**: Standard training time

### Memory Usage
```
During Training:
- GPU Memory: 6-7GB / 8GB
- System RAM: 8-16GB
- Disk Space: 5-10GB
```

### Model Quality
- **Good for basic municipal queries**
- **Understands German context**
- **Knows Arlesheim-specific information**
- **Limited compared to larger models**

## Troubleshooting RTX 3070

### Out of Memory Errors
```bash
# If you get OOM errors:
# 1. Reduce max_length
python train_rtx3070.py --max_length 128

# 2. Use even smaller model
# Edit train_rtx3070.py:
# model_name = "distilgpt2"

# 3. Reduce LoRA rank
# Edit train_rtx3070.py:
# lora_r = 2
```

### Slow Training
```bash
# If training is very slow:
# 1. Check GPU utilization
nvidia-smi

# 2. Reduce gradient accumulation
# Edit train_rtx3070.py:
# gradient_accumulation_steps = 16

# 3. Enable mixed precision
# (Already enabled in the script)
```

### Poor Model Quality
```bash
# If model responses are poor:
# 1. Increase training epochs
python train_rtx3070.py --epochs 5

# 2. Improve training data quality
# (Run train_arlesheim_model.py with more pages)

# 3. Use larger model if memory allows
# Try DialoGPT-medium with heavy optimization
```

## RTX 3070 vs Alternatives

### RTX 3070 Training
```
Pros:
✅ You own the hardware
✅ No ongoing costs
✅ Privacy (local training)
✅ Learning experience

Cons:
❌ Limited to small models
❌ Long training times
❌ High power consumption
❌ Heating issues
```

### Cloud Training Alternatives
```
Google Colab Pro+ ($50/month):
✅ T4/V100 GPUs (16GB)
✅ Professional environment
✅ Larger models possible
✅ No hardware wear

RunPod ($0.50-2/hour):
✅ RTX 4090 or A100 available
✅ Pay per use
✅ Much faster training
✅ Professional results
```

## Realistic Expectations

### What RTX 3070 Can Achieve
- **Basic conversational model** for Arlesheim
- **Simple Q&A responses** about municipal services
- **German language understanding**
- **Limited context awareness**

### What It Cannot Achieve
- **Complex reasoning** like GPT-4
- **Long document understanding**
- **Multi-turn conversations**
- **Professional-grade responses**

## Cost Analysis

### RTX 3070 Training Costs
```
Hardware: $500-600 (RTX 3070)
Power: $0.50-1.00 per training session
Time: 3-6 hours per model
Electricity: ~$2-4 per model
```

### Cloud Training Comparison
```
Google Colab Pro+: $50/month
RunPod RTX 4090: $1.50/hour × 6 hours = $9
Lambda A100: $2.50/hour × 3 hours = $7.50

Break-even: ~25-50 training sessions
```

## Recommended Workflow

### For RTX 3070 Owners
1. **Start with my training data preparation**
2. **Try RTX 3070 training** (learning experience)
3. **Compare with cloud results** (better quality)
4. **Use RTX 3070 for inference** (fast and free)

### For Best Results
1. **Use RTX 3070 for development/testing**
2. **Use cloud for production training**
3. **Deploy final model locally**

## Bottom Line

RTX 3070 can train municipal models, but:
- **Limited to small models** (117M parameters)
- **Long training times** (3-6 hours)
- **Basic quality results**
- **Good for learning/development**

**Better approach**: Use RTX 3070 for testing, cloud for production training!

The script I created will work on RTX 3070 and give you a functional Arlesheim assistant, just with more limitations than cloud training.
