- Start the server on port 8000
- Show you all access URLs

### **Option 2: Manual Start**
```bash
# Install dependency if needed
pip install jinja2==3.1.2

# Start server
python -m uvicorn core.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### **Option 3: Test First**
```bash
# Test everything is working
python test_admin_import.py

# Then start server
python start_admin_system.py
```

## üéØ Access Points

Once server is running:

- **Main RAG System**: http://localhost:8000/ui
- **Admin Interface**: http://localhost:8000/admin  
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## üìã Step-by-Step Usage Guide
