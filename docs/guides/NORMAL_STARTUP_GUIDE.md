# ✅ Normal Startup with Admin System

## You're Right - Use Normal Startup!

The admin system is **fully integrated** and works with normal server startup. No special script needed!

## 🚀 Normal Startup Process

```bash
# Just start normally as always:
python -m uvicorn core.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## ✅ What Works Automatically

1. **Admin Router**: Automatically loaded at `/admin`
2. **Settings Button**: Already added to main UI
3. **All Models**: Available for switching in admin interface
4. **Templates**: Jinja2 templates ready to serve admin pages

## 🎯 Access Points (Normal Startup)

Once server starts normally:

- **Main RAG System**: http://localhost:8000/ui
- **Admin Interface**: http://localhost:8000/admin
- **Settings Button**: Click it in main UI (top-right)

## 📋 What the Normal Startup Includes

### **Server Logs Show:**
```
INFO: Started server process
