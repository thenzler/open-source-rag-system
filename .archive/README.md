# Archive Directory

This directory contains components that have been archived during the simplification process to focus on MVP reliability.

## Structure

- `overengineered-services/` - Complex services that went beyond MVP scope
- `complex-tools/` - Advanced tools that weren't part of core functionality
- `old-features/` - Features that were removed during simplification

## Why These Were Archived

These components were moved to archive because they:
1. Added complexity beyond the MVP requirements
2. Created potential failure points without clear benefit
3. Diverted from the core mission of reliable document upload and querying
4. Required additional dependencies or maintenance overhead

## Recovery

If any of these components are needed in the future, they can be reviewed and potentially reintegrated with proper testing and reliability measures.
