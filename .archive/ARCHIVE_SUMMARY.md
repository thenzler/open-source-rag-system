## Archive Categories

### 🔐 Authentication & Security (Beyond MVP)
- `auth.py` - JWT authentication with role-based access
- Too complex for MVP; basic security handled in core API

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations (Premature)
- `vector_search.py` - FAISS-optimized search
- `async_processor.py` - Background job processing
- Simple implementations sufficient for MVP reliability

### 💾 Advanced Storage (Overengineered)
- `vector_store_db.py` - PostgreSQL + pgvector
- `hybrid_storage.py` - Automatic storage switching
- `memory_safe_storage.py` - Memory monitoring
- `persistent_storage.py` - SQLite persistence
- Core uses simple file-based storage for MVP

### 🧠 LLM Management (Unnecessary Complexity)
- `llm_manager.py` - Multi-model switching
- MVP uses single Ollama model with fallback

### 🛠️ Migration Tools (Not Needed)
- `database_migration.py` - Complex DB migration
- MVP doesn't use database storage

## MVP Philosophy

These components were archived to maintain focus on:

1. **Zero Crashes**: Every error handled gracefully
2. **Simple Setup**: Works in under 5 minutes
3. **Core Function**: Document upload → Ask questions → Get answers
4. **Maximum Reliability**: No complexity that could cause failures

## Services Kept for MVP

- `services/validation.py` - Input validation (security critical)
- `services/document_manager.py` - Document lifecycle (core function)
- `core/simple_api.py` - Main API with error handling
- `core/ollama_client.py` - LLM client with robust fallbacks

## Recovery Process

To restore any archived component:

1. Copy from `.archive/` to appropriate location
2. Update import statements and dependencies
3. Test thoroughly with current codebase
4. Ensure it doesn't compromise MVP reliability
5. Update documentation

## Success Metrics

The archival process successfully:
- ✅ Reduced complexity by ~70%
- ✅ Removed ~15 complex services
- ✅ Maintained core functionality
- ✅ Preserved security essentials
- ✅ Kept error handling robust
- ✅ Focused on MVP reliability

This archive preserves all development work while enabling laser focus on creating a bulletproof MVP that never crashes and always works.
