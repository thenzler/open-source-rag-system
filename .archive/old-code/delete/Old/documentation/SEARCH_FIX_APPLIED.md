# 🔍 Search Function Fix Applied

## Issue Fixed
**Problem**: Search was saying "no documents" even after uploading documents

## Root Cause
All search endpoints were checking the legacy `document_chunks` array instead of the memory-safe storage system where documents are actually stored.

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Added Helper Function**
```python
def has_documents() -> bool:
    """Check if we have any documents in either storage system"""
    # Check memory-safe storage first
    if memory_safe_storage:
        stats = memory_safe_storage.get_stats()
        return stats.get('documents', 0) > 0
    
    # Check legacy storage
    return len(document_chunks) > 0
```

### 2. **Updated All Endpoints**
Changed all search endpoints from:
```python
if not document_chunks:  # Only checked legacy storage
```

To:
```python
if not has_documents():  # Checks both storage systems
```

### 3. **Endpoints Fixed**
- ✅ `/api/v1/query` - Basic query endpoint
- ✅ `/api/v1/query/enhanced` - Enhanced query  
- ✅ `/api/v1/query-stream` - Streaming query
- ✅ `/api/chat` - Chat endpoint
- ✅ `/api/v1/query/optimized` - Optimized query (web frontend)
- ✅ `/api/v1/query/smart` - Smart query endpoint

## How to Test

1. **Restart your server**:
```bash
python simple_api.py
```

2. **Upload documents** through the web interface

3. **Try searching**: "Was ist Arlesheim" (or any question)

4. **Expected result**: Should now find and search your uploaded documents instead of saying "no documents"

## What Should Work Now

- ✅ **Document detection**: System recognizes uploaded documents
- ✅ **Search functionality**: Can search through uploaded content  
- ✅ **German responses**: Proper language handling
- ✅ **Relevance filtering**: 40% minimum similarity threshold
- ✅ **All interfaces**: Web frontend, API, chat - all working

**Try searching now - it should find your documents! 🔍✅**
