# 🔧 Upload Debug Fix Applied

## Root Cause Identified
The frontend was calling `/api/v1/status` but the backend only had `/api/status`. This meant:
- Status page showed 0 documents because it wasn't checking memory-safe storage
- Upload process was working but stats weren't being reported correctly
- Frontend couldn't see the documents that were actually uploaded

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Added Missing `/api/v1/status` Endpoint**
```python
@app.get("/api/v1/status")
async def get_api_v1_status():
    """Enhanced status endpoint that checks memory-safe storage first"""
```

### 2. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
- Added debug logging to upload process to check memory_safe_storage status
- Added debug logging to status endpoint to trace storage stats
- Shows exactly where documents are being stored (memory-safe vs legacy)

### 3. **Proper Statistics Reporting**
```python
if memory_safe_storage:
    storage_stats = memory_safe_storage.get_stats()
    statistics = {
        "documents_uploaded": storage_stats.get('documents', 0),
        "total_chunks": storage_stats.get('chunks', 0),
        "embeddings_created": storage_stats.get('embeddings', 0)
    }
```

## Test Steps

1. **Restart your server**:
```bash
python simple_api.py
```

2. **Upload a document** and watch the logs for:
```
DEBUG: memory_safe_storage is: <class 'services.memory_safe_storage.MemorySafeStorage'> (None=False)
DEBUG: memory_safe_storage exists, type: <class '...'>
Attempting to add document to memory-safe storage: filename.pdf
Document added to memory-safe storage with ID: 1
```

3. **Check status page** - should now show correct counts:
- Documents: 1+ (not 0)
- Chunks: 3+ (not 0)  
- Embeddings: 3+ (not 0)

4. **Try searching** - should now find documents properly

## Expected Results

**Before Fix:**
- Status: Documents: 0, Chunks: 0, Embeddings: 0 ❌
- Search: "Bitte laden Sie zuerst Dokumente hoch" ❌

**After Fix:**
- Status: Documents: 15+, Chunks: 69+, Embeddings: 69+ ✅
- Search: Returns actual results with similarity > 0.000 ✅

**The documents should now be visible and searchable! 🚀**
